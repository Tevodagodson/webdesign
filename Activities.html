            <img src="pier.jpg" class="video1" width="650">

            <p>This pier has a distinctive title as the oldest fishing pier on the Atlantic Coastline. First built in 1923 by local L.C. Kure, (whose father originally owned the majority of what is now "Kure" Beach), the initial goal was to create a pier that would be the centerpiece of a grand entertainment complex for Wilmington visitors. 
                Many attractions were built adjacent to the pier, including pavilions, bars,bath houses and cottages, but the pier remained standing long after these other early Kure Beach attractions were gone.</p>

            <h3> Carolina Beach State Park</h3>

            <img src="park.jpg" class="video1" width="650">

            <p>Located in New Hanover County 12 miles south of Wilmington, Carolina Beach State Park is home to the Venus flytrap, a unique carnivorous plant. The park is known for habitats like Sugarloaf Dune, a 50-foot dune that once served as a navigational marker for river pilots, as well as three limesink ponds that each feature a unique plant community. The park's marina provides access to the Cape Fear River and the Intracoastal Waterway, making the area popular for boaters and anglers. </p>
